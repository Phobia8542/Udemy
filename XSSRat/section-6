# Notes taken from XSSRat XSS survival guide course on Udemy
# VB XSS

General
# Similar to JS XSS - unsanitized input leads to XSS
# <img src=x> - If it attempts to render; examine further
# HMTL controller encoding MUST be done everywhere
Defensive measures
# HTML encoding of view - <%=Html.Encode(feedback.Message)%>
# HTML encodeing of controller - newFeedback.Message = Server.HtmlEncode(message)
Example: Unsanitized input  

<% For Each feedback As CustomerFeedback.Feedba
ck In ViewData.Model% >
<p> 
<%=feedback.EntryDate.ToShortTimeString()%> --
<%=feedback.Message%> 
</p> 
<% Next %> 
</asp:Content>
