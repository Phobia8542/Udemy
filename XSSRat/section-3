# Notes taken from XSSRat Survial guide Section 3: Reflected XSS
# Reflected XSS

General
# First-order or type 1 XSS - named by OWASP
# Identify where values are reflected in response
# Filter evasion cheat sheets
# Judge IMPACT REALISTICALLY
# Note special characters that are not properly encoded, replaced or filtered
Definition
# Injection must be executable code within a single HTTP reponse
# Not stored in application
# Not persistent
# Only effects user who clicked malicious link
# Attack vector belongs to URI or http params
# Not processed properly (filtered or sanitized) and returned to victim
Methods
#1 Design step: Attacker creates & tests a (offending) URI
#2 Social Engineering step: Attacker convinces victim to load URI
#3 Execution step: Execution of payload on victim's browser
Encoding
# %3c = <
# %3e = >
# %3cscript%3e
Detect input vectors (user controller variables & parameters)
# HTTP parameters
# POST parameters
# POST data
# Hidden fields
# Predefined radio or selection values
